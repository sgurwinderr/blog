## Code Walkthrough

#### Header File: `pch.h`

The `pch.h` file serves as the precompiled header file for the project. It includes essential libraries and headers required for the Direct3D 12 and DirectML operations. The purpose of a precompiled header is to speed up the compilation process by compiling the listed headers only once and reusing the compiled code in subsequent builds. Here's a breakdown of what each included library and header contributes:

- **Standard Libraries**: Includes libraries such as `<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<cstdint>`, `<cassert>`, `<fstream>`, `<iostream>`, `<iterator>`, `<vector>`, and `<optional>`. These provide basic functionalities like array manipulation, file handling, input/output operations, and more.

- **WIL Libraries**: `wil/result.h` and `wil/resource.h` from the Windows Implementation Libraries (WIL) simplify resource management and error handling, making the code more robust and readable.

- **Direct3D 12 and DirectML Headers**: 
  - `d3dx12_xs.h` and `d3d12_xs.h` are essential for Direct3D 12 operations.
  - `d3dx12.h` is a helper library that simplifies common tasks in Direct3D 12, reducing boilerplate code.
  - `dxgi1_4.h` is for the DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI), which handles enumerating graphics adapters and monitors.
  - `DirectML.h` is the DirectML header from the Windows SDK, enabling the use of machine learning features.

```

### 1. Direct3D 12 Initialization

The first step in utilizing DirectML is initializing the Direct3D 12 components. Direct3D 12 is a low-level graphics API that provides developers with control over GPU operations. Initialization involves enabling the debug layer, creating the Direct3D 12 device, command queue, command allocator, and command list. The debug layer is essential for development as it provides detailed error messages that aid in debugging. The device represents the virtual adapter and manages resources, while the command queue is responsible for sending commands to the GPU. The command allocator and command list work together to record and manage commands that will be executed by the GPU.

```cpp
#include "pch.h"
using Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr;

void InitializeDirect3D12(
    ComPtr<ID3D12Device> & d3D12Device,
    ComPtr<ID3D12CommandQueue> & commandQueue,
    ComPtr<ID3D12CommandAllocator> & commandAllocator,
    ComPtr<ID3D12GraphicsCommandList> & commandList) {
    
    ComPtr<ID3D12Debug> d3D12Debug;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(D3D12GetDebugInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(d3D12Debug.GetAddressOf())));
    d3D12Debug->EnableDebugLayer();

    ComPtr<IDXGIFactory4> dxgiFactory;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(CreateDXGIFactory1(IID_PPV_ARGS(dxgiFactory.GetAddressOf())));

    ComPtr<IDXGIAdapter> dxgiAdapter;
    UINT adapterIndex = 0;
    HRESULT hr;
    do {
        dxgiAdapter = nullptr;
        THROW_IF_FAILED(dxgiFactory->EnumAdapters(adapterIndex, dxgiAdapter.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf()));
        ++adapterIndex;

        hr = ::D3D12CreateDevice(dxgiAdapter.Get(), D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0, IID_PPV_ARGS(d3D12Device.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf()));
        if (hr == DXGI_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED) continue;
        THROW_IF_FAILED(hr);
    } while (hr != S_OK);

    D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_DESC commandQueueDesc = {};
    commandQueueDesc.Type = D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_DIRECT;
    commandQueueDesc.Flags = D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAG_NONE;

    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommandQueue(&commandQueueDesc, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(commandQueue.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf())));
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommandAllocator(D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_DIRECT, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(commandAllocator.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf())));
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommandList(0, D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_DIRECT, commandAllocator.Get(), nullptr, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(commandList.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf())));
}
```

### 2. DirectML Device and Operator Initialization

With Direct3D 12 initialized, the next step is creating the DirectML device. This device acts as an interface for executing machine learning operations on the GPU. The device creation involves specifying any flags necessary for the DirectML device, although typically, no special flags are needed. Creating the DirectML device sets the stage for defining and executing machine learning operators.

```cpp
int main() {
    ComPtr<ID3D12Device> d3D12Device;
    ComPtr<ID3D12CommandQueue> commandQueue;
    ComPtr<ID3D12CommandAllocator> commandAllocator;
    ComPtr<ID3D12GraphicsCommandList> commandList;

    // Initialize Direct3D 12.
    InitializeDirect3D12(d3D12Device, commandQueue, commandAllocator, commandList);

    // Create the DirectML device.
    DML_CREATE_DEVICE_FLAGS dmlCreateDeviceFlags = DML_CREATE_DEVICE_FLAG_NONE;
    ComPtr<IDMLDevice> dmlDevice;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(DMLCreateDevice(d3D12Device.Get(), dmlCreateDeviceFlags, IID_PPV_ARGS(dmlDevice.GetAddressOf())));

    // Define tensor sizes and properties.
    constexpr UINT tensorSizes[4] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    constexpr UINT tensorElementCount = tensorSizes[0] * tensorSizes[1] * tensorSizes[2] * tensorSizes[3];
    DML_BUFFER_TENSOR_DESC dmlBufferTensorDesc = {};
    dmlBufferTensorDesc.DataType = DML_TENSOR_DATA_TYPE_FLOAT32;
    dmlBufferTensorDesc.Flags = DML_TENSOR_FLAG_NONE;
    dmlBufferTensorDesc.DimensionCount = ARRAYSIZE(tensorSizes);
    dmlBufferTensorDesc.Sizes = tensorSizes;
    dmlBufferTensorDesc.TotalTensorSizeInBytes = DMLCalcBufferTensorSize(dmlBufferTensorDesc.DataType, dmlBufferTensorDesc.DimensionCount, dmlBufferTensorDesc.Sizes, nullptr);
```

### 3. Define and Create DirectML Operator
Once the tensor is defined, the next step is to define and create a DirectML operator. Operators represent the mathematical operations performed on tensors. In this guide, we use the Identity operator, which outputs the same value as the input tensor. Defining the operator involves specifying the input and output tensor descriptions, and creating the operator using the DirectML device. This operator will be compiled into a form that can be executed on the GPU.

```cpp
    // Define and create a DirectML operator (Identity operator).
    ComPtr<IDMLOperator> dmlOperator;
    DML_TENSOR_DESC dmlTensorDesc = {};
    dmlTensorDesc.Type = DML_TENSOR_TYPE_BUFFER;
    dmlTensorDesc.Desc = &dmlBufferTensorDesc;

    DML_ELEMENT_WISE_IDENTITY_OPERATOR_DESC dmlIdentityOperatorDesc = {};
    dmlIdentityOperatorDesc.InputTensor = &dmlTensorDesc;
    dmlIdentityOperatorDesc.OutputTensor = &dmlTensorDesc;

    DML_OPERATOR_DESC dmlOperatorDesc = {};
    dmlOperatorDesc.Type = DML_OPERATOR_ELEMENT_WISE_IDENTITY;
    dmlOperatorDesc.Desc = &dmlIdentityOperatorDesc;

    THROW_IF_FAILED(dmlDevice->CreateOperator(&dmlOperatorDesc, IID_PPV_ARGS(dmlOperator.GetAddressOf())));
```

### 4. Compile the Operator
Once the tensor is defined, the next step is to define and create a DirectML operator. Operators represent the mathematical operations performed on tensors. In this guide, we use the Identity operator, which outputs the same value as the input tensor. Defining the operator involves specifying the input and output tensor descriptions, and creating the operator using the DirectML device. This operator will be compiled into a form that can be executed on the GPU.

```cpp
    // Compile the operator.
    ComPtr<IDMLCompiledOperator> dmlCompiledOperator;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(dmlDevice->CompileOperator(dmlOperator.Get(), DML_EXECUTION_FLAG_NONE, IID_PPV_ARGS(dmlCompiledOperator.GetAddressOf())));
```

### 5. Create Descriptor Heap and Binding Table
After compiling the operator, the next step is to create a descriptor heap and binding table. The descriptor heap is a GPU resource that stores descriptors, which are references to resources such as buffers and textures. The binding table maps these descriptors to the inputs and outputs of the compiled operator. This setup allows the GPU to access the necessary resources during execution.

```cpp
    // Create descriptor heap and binding table.
    ComPtr<ID3D12DescriptorHeap> descriptorHeap;
    D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_DESC descriptorHeapDesc = {};
    descriptorHeapDesc.Type = D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_TYPE_CBV_SRV_UAV;
    descriptorHeapDesc.NumDescriptors = 1;
    descriptorHeapDesc.Flags = D3D12_DESCRIPTOR_HEAP_FLAG_SHADER_VISIBLE;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateDescriptorHeap(&descriptorHeapDesc, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(descriptorHeap.GetAddressOf())));

    // Set the descriptor heap(s).
    ID3D12DescriptorHeap* d3D12DescriptorHeaps[] = { descriptorHeap.Get() };
    commandList->SetDescriptorHeaps(ARRAYSIZE(d3D12DescriptorHeaps), d3D12DescriptorHeaps);
```

### 6. Initialize and Execute the Operator
With the binding table set up, itâ€™s time to initialize and execute the operator. This step involves creating and uploading input tensor data to the GPU. The input data is typically stored in a buffer, which is then bound to the binding table. The operator is executed by recording commands in the command list and dispatching them to the command queue. Execution involves specifying the root signature, descriptor table, and dispatching the compute shader to process the data.

```cpp
    // Create and initialize binding table.
    DML_BINDING_TABLE_DESC dmlBindingTableDesc = {};
    dmlBindingTableDesc.Dispatchable = dmlCompiledOperator.Get();
    dmlBindingTableDesc.CPUDescriptorHandle = descriptorHeap->GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart();
    dmlBindingTableDesc.GPUDescriptorHandle = descriptorHeap->GetGPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart();
    dmlBindingTableDesc.SizeInDescriptors = 1;

    ComPtr<IDMLBindingTable> dmlBindingTable;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(dmlDevice->CreateBindingTable(&dmlBindingTableDesc, IID_PPV_ARGS(dmlBindingTable.GetAddressOf())));

    // Create tensor buffers.
    ComPtr<ID3D12Resource> uploadBuffer, inputBuffer, outputBuffer;
    UINT64 tensorBufferSize = dmlBufferTensorDesc.TotalTensorSizeInBytes;

    // Create and upload input tensor data.
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommittedResource(&CD3DX12_HEAP_PROPERTIES(D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD), D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_NONE, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_DESC::Buffer(tensorBufferSize), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_GENERIC_READ, nullptr, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(uploadBuffer.GetAddressOf())));
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommittedResource(&CD3DX12_HEAP_PROPERTIES(D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT), D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_NONE, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_DESC::Buffer(tensorBufferSize, D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_UNORDERED_ACCESS), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST, nullptr, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(inputBuffer.GetAddressOf())));

    std::array<FLOAT, tensorElementCount> inputTensorElementArray;
    for (auto &element : inputTensorElementArray) {
        element = 1.618f;
    }

    D3D12_SUBRESOURCE_DATA tensorSubresourceData = {};
    tensorSubresourceData.pData = inputTensorElementArray.data();
    tensorSubresourceData.RowPitch = static_cast<LONG_PTR>(tensorBufferSize);
    tensorSubresourceData.SlicePitch = tensorSubresourceData.RowPitch;

    // Upload the input tensor to the GPU.
    ::UpdateSubresources(commandList.Get(), inputBuffer.Get(), uploadBuffer.Get(), 0, 0, 1, &tensorSubresourceData);
    commandList->ResourceBarrier(1, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_BARRIER::Transition(inputBuffer.Get(), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST, D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_UNORDERED_ACCESS));

    // Bind input and output buffers to the binding table.
    DML_BUFFER_BINDING inputBufferBinding = { inputBuffer.Get(), 0, tensorBufferSize };
    DML_BINDING_DESC inputBindingDesc = { DML_BINDING_TYPE_BUFFER, &inputBufferBinding };
    dmlBindingTable->BindInputs(1, &inputBindingDesc);

    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommittedResource(&CD3DX12_HEAP_PROPERTIES(D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT), D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_NONE, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_DESC::Buffer(tensorBufferSize, D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_UNORDERED_ACCESS), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_UNORDERED_ACCESS, nullptr, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(outputBuffer.GetAddressOf())));

    DML_BUFFER_BINDING output

BufferBinding = { outputBuffer.Get(), 0, tensorBufferSize };
    DML_BINDING_DESC outputBindingDesc = { DML_BINDING_TYPE_BUFFER, &outputBufferBinding };
    dmlBindingTable->BindOutputs(1, &outputBindingDesc);
```

### 7. Execute the Operator and Read Back Results
Once the operator is dispatched, itâ€™s necessary to wait for the GPU to complete execution. This is achieved by using a fence, a synchronization primitive that allows the CPU to wait for the GPU to reach a certain point in its command queue. After the GPU finishes execution, the results are copied from the GPU to a readback buffer on the CPU. This buffer is mapped to access the output tensor data, which can then be read and processed by the application.

```cpp
    // Record commands to execute the operator.
    commandList->SetComputeRootSignature(dmlDevice->GetRootSignature());
    commandList->SetComputeRootDescriptorTable(0, descriptorHeap->GetGPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart());
    commandList->Dispatch(1, 1, 1);

    // Prepare and execute command list.
    THROW_IF_FAILED(commandList->Close());
    ID3D12CommandList* commandLists[] = { commandList.Get() };
    commandQueue->ExecuteCommandLists(ARRAYSIZE(commandLists), commandLists);

    // Wait for GPU to finish.
    ComPtr<ID3D12Fence> fence;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateFence(0, D3D12_FENCE_FLAG_NONE, IID_PPV_ARGS(fence.GetAddressOf())));
    HANDLE event = CreateEvent(nullptr, FALSE, FALSE, nullptr);
    THROW_IF_FAILED(commandQueue->Signal(fence.Get(), 1));
    THROW_IF_FAILED(fence->SetEventOnCompletion(1, event));
    WaitForSingleObject(event, INFINITE);
    CloseHandle(event);

    // Copy the results from GPU to CPU.
    ComPtr<ID3D12Resource> readbackBuffer;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(d3D12Device->CreateCommittedResource(&CD3DX12_HEAP_PROPERTIES(D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_READBACK), D3D12_HEAP_FLAG_NONE, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_DESC::Buffer(tensorBufferSize), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_DEST, nullptr, IID_GRAPHICS_PPV_ARGS(readbackBuffer.GetAddressOf())));

    commandList->ResourceBarrier(1, &CD3DX12_RESOURCE_BARRIER::Transition(outputBuffer.Get(), D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_UNORDERED_ACCESS, D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COPY_SOURCE));
    commandList->CopyResource(readbackBuffer.Get(), outputBuffer.Get());
    THROW_IF_FAILED(commandList->Close());
    commandQueue->ExecuteCommandLists(ARRAYSIZE(commandLists), commandLists);

    // Map and read back the output tensor data.
    FLOAT* outputTensorData;
    THROW_IF_FAILED(readbackBuffer->Map(0, nullptr, reinterpret_cast<void**>(&outputTensorData)));
    for (UINT i = 0; i < tensorElementCount; ++i) {
        std::cout << outputTensorData[i] << " ";
    }
    readbackBuffer->Unmap(0, nullptr);

    return 0;
}
```
