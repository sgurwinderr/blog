# Introduction:

In the realm of deep learning, model performance is paramount. Whether you're working on image classification, object detection, or any other computer vision task, the efficiency of your model can make or break your application. PyTorch Profiler is an invaluable tool for developers looking to optimize their models. It provides detailed insights into the time and memory consumption of model operations during execution. In this article, we'll explore how to use PyTorch Profiler with a ResNet model to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

Setting Up the Environment: Before diving into profiling, ensure that PyTorch is installed in your environment. If not, you can easily install it using pip with the following command:

```
pip install torch torchvision
```
Once PyTorch is installed, you're ready to start profiling your model.

Profiling a ResNet Model: ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is widely used in various computer vision tasks. Let's walk through the steps to profile a ResNet model using PyTorch Profiler.

1. Importing Necessary Modules Begin by importing the required modules from PyTorch and torchvision:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from torch.profiler import profile, record_function, ProfilerActivity
```

2. Loading the Model Load a pre-trained ResNet model, such as ResNet-18, from the torchvision library:

```python
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
```

3. Preparing the Input Create a dummy input tensor that simulates a batch of images with the appropriate dimensions for ResNet (3 color channels, 224x224 pixels):
```python
input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
```
4. Setting Up the Device Determine if a GPU is available and move the model and input tensor to the GPU for faster computation:
```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
input = input.to(device)
```
5. Switching to Evaluation Mode Ensure the model is in evaluation mode to disable training-specific behaviors:
```python
model.eval()
```
6. Profiling the Model Use the PyTorch Profiler within a context manager, specifying the activities to profile (CPU and CUDA) and enabling tensor shape recording:
```python
with profile(activities=[ProfilerActivity.CPU, ProfilerActivity.CUDA], record_shapes=True) as prof:
    with record_function("model_inference"):
        model(input)

```

7. Analyzing the Results After running the model inference, print the profiler output, focusing on the operations that consume the most CPU time:
```python
print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by="cpu_time_total", row_limit=10))
```

8. Using tracing functionality
```python
prof.export_chrome_trace("trace.json")
```
You can examine the sequence of profiled operators and CUDA kernels in Chrome trace viewer (chrome://tracing):

The profiler output will present a table summarizing the performance of various operations within the model. This table includes the time spent on each operation and the shapes of the tensors involved.
